FULLY FREE

Spaced repetition made for UPSC
You’ll see mistakes more often and mastered items less often.
 More time on weaknesses. Less time on strengths. Faster improvement.
 No other UPSC app does this meaningfully.
Know exactly what to study next
Yaad doesn’t just score one mock. It tracks all your answers over time to form a true picture of mastery.
 Mastery bars show where you stand (e.g., Polity 78% mastered, Geography 42% mastered).
 With one tap, revise only your weak areas and watch the list get smaller each day.

How it works on Day 1
Open Yaad and test yourself on PYQs (active recall).
 Whatever you miss returns in about 1 minute so you learn from the mistake while it’s fresh.
 Get it right later? It shows up again on Day 1, 3, 7, 21… (spaced repetition).
 Questions you already know appear less often, so you save time and build recall where it’s needed.
Most of us misjudge what we know. Yaad removes the guesswork with data.

Proof it works
Why this approach wins
Active recall helps you remember more than passive rereading or highlighting — see <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/file/feeds/PDF/9780674729018_sample.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Make It Stick</em> (Harvard University Press)</a>.


Spacing beats cramming and unstructured practice, so you forget less and don’t have to relearn topics — see <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/mit-faculty/research-based-learning-findings/spaced-and-interleaved-practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT Open Learning: Spaced & Interleaved Practice</a>.


Testing reduces overconfidence and reveals your true weak areas — discussed in <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/file/feeds/PDF/9780674729018_sample.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Make It Stick</em></a>.
